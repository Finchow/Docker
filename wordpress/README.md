# Wordpress Server

customisable wordpress server for docker-compose

ports used: loclahost:80:80

remember to change "localhost" to your local ip and change "passwd" to your disired password
the port number can be changed to any port you have access to 

the url for the website should be: http://"your_local_ip"/

and if you changed the port append: http://"your_local_ip"/:"portnumber"
(if you kept the port at 80:80 you do not need this)
